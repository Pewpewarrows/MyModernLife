My personal blog, with the intention of making it into a generic and custom 
django CMS that I can use as a foundation for any new projects

TODO:
0. Keep this list for internal reminders.  Big-ticket stuff on GitHub.
1. Change automagically from HTML5 -> 4 if user is on a legacy browser.
2. Fix cache backend by actually installing it on dev box
3. Spruce up the 403/404/500 server error pages.
