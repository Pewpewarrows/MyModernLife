My personal blog, with the intention of making it into a generic and custom 
django CMS that I can use as a foundation for any new projects

Usual spiel, see conf/requirements.pip.txt for the pip file.

TODO:

1. Fix cache backend by actually installing it on dev box
2. Spruce up the 403/404/500 server error pages.
